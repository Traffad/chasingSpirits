# chasingSpirits
Playing through our boardgame ChasingSpirits to try new game mechanics.
I wrote it in processing (simplified Java) with Android in mind in the long run if we would make a boardgame later on.

Get processing at: https://processing.org/download/?processing

Help needed to make the testing of new game mechanics and to make all the graphics and love.
